            <h1>Matrix server</h1>
            <p>The easiest way to get in contact with me is trough my Matrix server. There we usually shitpost and discuss tech (GNU/Linux, crypto, *BSD etc.) related topics but you can talk about anything really just don't be a retard. We VC almost every day, make sure to join!</p>
            <p>If you don't know what Matrix is, its basically  an open source, decentralized chat protocol, its like Discord but better in every way. You can learn more about it <a href="https://matrix.org">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I don't use Discord or any other chat app, anyone claiming to be me is just an impostor (sus).</p>
